the

less
fluid

just
stopped
using
wah
pedals
completely.a
couple
years
ago
,
i
bought
a
digitech
xp-100
whammy
wah
,
mainly
for
the
whammy
effects
to
learn
how
to
do
morello
's
style

<s>
since
it
has
some
digital
wah
patches
was
available
,
i
started
to
use
them
too
and
was
happy
because
it
does
n't
have
a
treadle
that
will
break
like
on
my
gcb-95
.
</s>
<s>
the
wahs
were
usable
,
but
just
did
not
sound
as
good.finally
i
was
supposed
to
play
alice
in
chains
,
``
man
in
the
box
''

the
digitech
was
just
not
going
to
cut
it
.

so
,
it
was
time
to
get
a
real

i
searched
around
on
youtube
for
demos

talked
to
people
to
see
what
they
used
.
</s>
<s>
i
chose
the
535q
because
people
told
me
that
they
've
never
had
a
maintenance
problem
with
them
,
and
it
is
very
versatile.you
can
get
several
kinds
of
wah
sounds
by
tweaking
the
dials
,
and
they
have
some
great
suggestions
in
the
manual
to
get
started
.
</s>
<s>
i
set
mine
on
the
cantrell
setting
and
have
left
it
there
because
i
mainly
use
the
wah
when
playing
early
alternative
90s
hard
rock
styles
.
</s>
<s>
that
setting
works
will
in
songs
like
ratm
,
``
bulls
on
parade
''
as
well
,
including
to
create
the
white
noise
for
scratch
dj
sounds.i
still
do
not
use
wah
pedals
terribly
often
,
but
it
is
nice
to
have
a
reliable
wah
that
can
do
whatever
i
need
it
to
by
simply
adjusting
a
couple
knobs
.

<s>
i
think
that
as
long
as
i
need
a
wah
pedal

this

suit

it
will
remain
on

it

on

however
,
i
play
standing

manipulating

difficult
to
control

of
balancing
on
one
foot
and
the
sensitivity
of
some
of
the
pedals.this

gives
a
simulation
of
the

swells

since
the
steel

always
being
played

pedal
works
along
with
that
technique
.
</s>
<s>
i
combine
it
with
a
sustainer
to
make
the
swells
extend
a
little
,
and
it
gives
a
fair
approximation
of
using
a
volume
pedal
to
swell
the
notes.i
tried
this
with

guitar

it
's
not
the
same
.

for

it

add
an

it

depend
on
the
song

n't

on

the
wider
strap
distributes
the

also
helps

good

to
get

right

flaw
i
found
was

came

had

fixed

quality

serviceable

body
was
what
really
surprised

do
believe

furniture

would

this

hold
up

squeal

to
watch

still

her
husband
has
forbidden
her
to
bring
the
violin
home

can
play
so
she
comes
over
here
to
practice

has
led

i
took
the
resonator
off

found
that

had
an

gap
between

neck

the
body
,

naturally
that
scared
me
,

i
tightened
the
metal
rod
,

it
brought
the
neck
down
to
the
body
,

brought
the
strings
down
to
the
perfect
height.now
it
's
a
very
beautiful
instrument
,

it
sounds
pretty
good
too
,

,
it
's
not
a
gold
tone

you

2-3x

much

only
thing
i

a

the

it

ouch
those

at

between

to

you
are
really
bending
the

so
if

you
would

one

once

you
can
permanently

just
be
prepared
to
cut
the
levels
down

away

trying
out

you
will
likely
get
some
very
unpleasant
feedback

this
is
a

more
difficult

</s>
<s>
anyhow
i
digress
,
but
for
a
reason
.
</s>
<s>
light
gauge
strings
are
subject
to
tuning
problems
if
you
have
big
fat
frets
like
the
.050
&#34;
found
on
gibons
and
esp-ltd
's
.
</s>
<s>
when
you
squeeze
the
string
to
fret
it
,
with
light
gauge
strings
it
is
all
too
easy
to
squeeze
it
all
the
way
to
the
fret
board
.
</s>
<s>
with
x-large
jumbo
frets
that
can
be
quite
a
distance
making
the
guitar
go
out
of
tune
.
</s>
<s>
the
cure
for
that
is
using
heavier
gauge
strings
such
as
10
's
or
more
so
it
makes
it
possible
to
determine
quite
easily
just
where
the
top
of
the
fret
is
without
doing
the
full
squeeze
all
the
way
to
the
fret
board
.
</s>
<s>
so
most
capo
's
work
with
10
's
and
on
up
because
there
is
a
lot
more
tension
on
the
strings
.
</s>
<s>
so
a
lot
of
capos
can
create
a
comfortable
fit
fully
fretting
the
strings
without
them
going
into
the
sharp
note
zone.so
since
i
use
lighter
gauge
strings
,
and
even
9
's
are
subject
to
the
same
limitation
,
i
have
had
a
hard
time
finding
a
capo
that
would
sit
comfortably
at
the
top
of
the
range
between
the
fret
and
the
board
,
and
still
squeeze
the
string
sufficiently
so
as
to
not
create
any
buzz
and
do
so
without
making
the
string
too
sharp
.

?

i

i
have

to
be
honest
with

i
was

how

it
to

i
used
the

fodder

tenth

</s>
<s>
okay
back
to
the
explanation.with
the
snark
you
tune
the
open
string
until
the
line
stays
in
the
center
without
wavering
off
to
one
side
.
</s>
<s>
the
only
problem
is
that
most
any
headstock
tuner
i
have
seen
they
are
n't
superbly
accurate
.
</s>
<s>
-lrb-
the
peterson
headstock
tuner
i
sent
back
because
it
was
acting
crazy
.
</s>
<s>
anyhow
...
-rrb-
so
the
secret
to
using
the
snark
which
i
like
best
out
of
the
headstock
tuners
i
have
tried
is
to
tune
the
open
string
first
,
and
then
fret
the
string
on
let
's
say
the
5th
fret
.
</s>
<s>
you
will
occasionally
find
that
a
string
in
the
open
position
registers
as
being
in
tune
,
even
though
it
may
be
a
little
sharp
,
or
a
little
flat
,
so
when
you
strum
the
whole
chord
you
will
get
a
desire
to
tune
it
,
so
your
ears
can
hear
it
,
in
order
to
get
it
spot
on
.
</s>
<s>
there
is
nothing
more
beautiful
than
a
perfectly
tuned
guitar
,
and
nothing
worse
than
one
that
is
well
out
of
tune.so
by
tuning
the
open
string
,
and
then
tuning
the
fretted
string
,
once
both
are
in
tune
it
is
right
on
.
</s>
<s>
so
in
the
open
position
if
by
chance
it
is
a
tiny
bit
sharp
,
not
enough
to
register
on
the
tuner
,
when
you
fret
that
string
,
for
example
on
the
5th
fret
that
naturally
stretches
the
string
a
little
bit
,
making
it
sharper
,
which
will
now
show
on
the
snark
as
a
note
that
is
too
sharp
.
</s>
<s>
once
you
balance
the
open
string
,
and
the
fretted
string
you
really
have
a
wonderfully
tuned
instrument

you
do
