anything
but
a
5-star
review
to
a
boss
product
,
since
i
'm
such
a
big
fan
of
their
product
line
and
build
quality
overall
.

those
compliments
apply
equally
to
the
cs-3
compression
sustainer
.

and
it
does
do
the
job
reasonably
well
without
me
having
to
worry
about
putting
a
less-reliable
brand
in
my
signal
chain.however
,
there
are
some
minor
issues
with
this
pedal
that
you
need
to
know
.
</s>
<s>
the
two
most
common
complaints
that
i
see
are
that
it
adds
``
noise
''
to
your
amp
and
that
it
changes
the
tone
a
bit
.
</s>
<s>
the
former
complaint
is
probably
true
,
though
if
you
're
enough
of
a
hobbyist
to
use
a
compression
sustainer
,
you
're
probably
already
contemplated
using
a
noise
gate/suppressor
,
such
as
the
boss
ns-2
.
</s>
<s>
problem
solved.as
for
the
latter
complaint
-lrb-
changes
tone
-rrb-
,
that
's
also
true
,
but
it
's
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
if
you
like
the
tone
that
results
.
</s>
<s>
the
whole
point
of
the
cs-3
is
that
it
's
supposed
to
cut
out
the
extremes
of
your
tone
and
sustain
it
.
</s>
<s>
this
can
result
in
a
muddy
,
``
neutered
''
tone
,
though
you
can
play
with
the
tone
and
other
settings
to
help
it
.
</s>
<s>
i
also
find
that
with
the
settings
all
at
12
o'clock
,
the
output
is
too
quiet
compared
to
other
pedals
at
default
settings.really
,
while
boss
pedals
are
considered
to
be
``
expensive
''
compared
to
many
of
the
other
effects
out
there
,
the
cs-3
should
really
be
viewed
as
a
``
budget
''
or
``
entry
level
''
compressor
,
when
you
consider
that
most
of
the
quality
compressors
are
either
in
rack
units
or
something
like
a
keeley
compressor
costing
north
of
$
200
.
</s>
<s>
the
best
thing
you
can
say
about
the
boss
-lrb-
even
compared
to
the
similarly-priced
mxr
options
-rrb-
is
that
the
cs-3
gives
you
a
great
deal
of
control
over
your
compression
for
a
reasonable
price
.
</s>
<s>
the
biggest
negative
of
the
pedal
,
in
my
opinion
,
is
that
the
resulting
sound
might
seem
a
little
too
...
compressed.but
there
are
a
lot
of
things
you
could
do
with
a
cs-3
,
and
it
works
best
paired
with
other
pedals
-lrb-
chorus
,
delay
,
some
distortions
-rrb-
that
you
're
trying
to
smooth
out
.
</s>
<s>
ultimately
,
it
's
a
pedal
that
could
have
been
better
,

there
are
n't
too
many
significantly
better
alternatives
until
you
get
north
of
$
100
anyway

so
you
are
likely
to
have
to
choose
between
grinding
down

will
increase
the

the
strap
button
has
a

therefore
any
lateral
stress
-lrb-
i.e.
weight
of

magnified
by
more
than
3x

a
9

the
general
sound

warm

plenty

so
layering

can
get
you

so

you
get

deep

punchy
sound

fits

one
difference
is
that
it

an
additional

knob

a

the

knob
on

a

filter

the
other
difference
is
that
the
sansamp

tougher

components

so
would
last
longer
for
the
gigging
musician
.
</s>
<s>
but
do
n't
take
me
wrong
,
the
bass
attack
uses
a
solid
metal
chassis

does
n't
feel
cheap
at
all.the
harmonics
knob
adds
some
overdrive
,
and
gets
kind
of
farty
when
turned
up
100
%
but
sounds
pretty
good
at
75-90
%
.
</s>
<s>
it
does
n't
do
that
high
gain
super
gritty/fizzy
distortion
though
,
for
that
you
could
connect
a
distortion
pedal
to
the
parallel
output
,
or
duplicate
the
track
in
your
daw
and
add
a
distortion
plugin.this
pedal
is
very
versatile
.
</s>

i
found
that
the
shape
knob
is
indispensable
;
it
takes
the
place
of
a
mid
control
.
</s>

for
example
,
by
notching
-lrb-
reducing
-rrb-
the
boomy
60-130
hz
region
and
turning
up
the
level
,
you
get
plenty
more
mids
.
</s>
<s>
the
treble
and
bright
control
seem
very
similar
to
each
other
,
one
seems
to
amplify
the
4k
region
,
the
other
the
5k
but
that
's
just
an
estimate
.
</s>
<s>
by
keeping
both
of
those
around
10
o'clock
and
the
shape
control
beneath
115
hz
,
i
can
get
a
solid
,
deep
,
yet
mid-full
sound
for
a
metal
mix
.
</s>
<s>
thus
anyone
who
thinks
this
pedal
is
all
bass
and
treble
and
no
mids
,
ought
to
try
settings
along
those
lines.another
good
feature
is
that
this
pedal
can
run

battery
needed

you

sound

bass
attack

tweak
it
further

i
believe
he
uses
a
drri
with

this
pedal
sounds
great

<s>
if
you
did
a
blind
test
between
this
pedal

an
overdrive

north

$
100
you
may
be
surprised
-
particularly
if
your
other
gear
-lrb-
amp

guitar
-rrb-
are
halfway
decent
.

<s>
what
i
did
note
though
,
was
that
this
pedal
has
a
wee
bit
more
gain
and
a
little
less
treble
than
my
other
ts
type
pedals
.

that
does
n't
make
it
worse
or
better
-
just
different
.

<s>
the
`
mid-hump
'
is
actually
less
pronounced
than
in
a
tubescreamer
,

is
a
good
thing
imho
.

already
enough

it
will
not
perform
miracles

lousy
sounding
guitars

amplifiers

<s>
incidentally
,
the
pedal
plays
well
with
other
dirt
boxes
.
</s>
<s>
since
it
is
n't
true
bypass
,
you
will
likely
get
some
tone
suck
if
you
run
a
bunch
of
these
in
your
chain
,
but
if
the
rest
of
your
pedals
have
decent
bypass
you
will
be
fine
.

-lrb-
this

i
bought
this

back

i
had
a
horrible
experience

this

that

my

i
bought
this
mixer
without
looking
at

anything

i
didnt
know
how
to
use
it.i
hooked
this
up
to
my
desktop

the
pink
microphone
input

got
a
horrible

terrible
mix
,
the
hiss
from

ruined
it
-lrb-
i
nearly
had
a
panic
attack
-rrb-
,
so
i
took
like
9
months
to
do
research

and
found
out

behringer
made
the
uca202/uca222
for
this
unit

the
802
mixer
,
to
remove
the
hiss
and
unwanted
noise.so
buy
this
with
the
uca202/uca222
to
clear
up
your
recordings
,
do
not
buy
a
``
rca

if
your
using
this

modern

cut
bass

through

the

by
switching

the
gain
on

already
fairly
high

then
,
for
the
songs
that
utilize
a
little
heavier

i
'll
kick
on
my
ts9dx
,
with
the

pretty
low
-lrb-
9

the

add
more
low

if

're
after
a

mid

i
would
only
recommend
this
pedal
as
a
solo
boost
,
where
the
mids
will
help
cut
through

conclusion
,
it
's
probably
safe
to
say
that
most
people
who

playing

recommend

leave
small
dents

pickup
in
the
regular
position
inside
the
body
behind
the
bridge
,

just
ran
the
cable
out
from
the
sound
hole
.
</s>
<s>
the
jack
is
held
onto
the
pickguard
with
some
scotch
outdoor
mounting
tape
-lrb-
which
is
kind
of
like
really
strong
gum
,
it
can
be
removed
without
leaving
sticky
residue
-rrb-
;
which
holds
it
in
place
well
enough
to
plug
in
a
cable
and
move
around
as
long
as
i
do
n't
jerk
the
guitar
quickly.sound
qualityi
plugged
it
into
my
cheap
,
regular
guitar
amp
,
and
whoa
!
</s>
<s>
the
package
mentions
two
locations
you
can
place
the
pickup
,
and
because
i
needed
to
run
it
through
the
sound
hole
,
i
could
only
place
it
where
more
treble
is
picked
up
.
</s>
<s>
so
i
have
to
compensate
on
my
amp
by
turning
down
the
treble
to
7
or
lowerbecause
the
pickup
is
a
transducer
,
no
electrical
feedback/interference
is
picked
up
,
so
the
sound
will
be
very
clear
and
crisp
.
</s>
<s>
it
would
probably
sound
even
better
on
an
amp
with
better
electric
shielding
;
the
only
noise
i
get
even
at
max
gain
,
max
input
volume
,
is
from
the
amp
itself
,
heard
with
every
instrument
i
plug
into
it
if
i
turn
the
master
volume
up
too
high.another
thing
to
consider
is
that
transducers
pickup
vibrations
,
so
it
wo
n't
pick
up
sound
when
placed
a
millimeter
away
from
the
guitar
body
,
but
will
when
touching
it
.
</s>
<s>
so
with
that
in
mind
,
the
pickup
will
strongly
output
every
sound
you
make
to
the
guitar
body
;
like
it
brushing
up
against
your
body
,
a
zipper
hitting
the
guitar
,
your
fingers
sliding
on
the
strings
etc.

beyond
these

wins
out

aesthetics

that
it
looks

feels
to
be
of

pressure

keep
all
the
open

face

pulling

intrude
on
either
my
thumb
when

's
behind

neck

peeking
over

,
or
the
side
of
my
index
finger
when
i
'm
at
the
first
fret
playing
chords
or
single
notes
.3
-rrb-
the
design
should
n't
require
excessive
hand
pressure
or
too
much
fussiness
to
apply
,
reposition
,
and
remove
the
capo
-lrb-

two-handed
fussiness

the
tri-action
capo
scored
big
on
all
three
criteria

it
held
tight
on
a
variety
of
acoustic
and
electric
neck
widths
and
profiles
,
from
a
martin
om-1
with
a
wide
rounded
shape
to
a
gibson
l4
archtop
with
a
baseball
bat-thick
and
round
neck
,
a
skinny
sg
,
a
wide
and
soft
c-profiled
ibanez
artist
,
and
an
imitation
strat
with
a
hard-radiused
fingerboard
and
classic
c-shaped
neck.planet
waves
came
up
with
a
design
that
works
both
``
over
and
under
''
:
i
can
squeeze
the
capo
with
my
fingers
with
its
back
snug
in
my
palm
or
flip
it
over
and
use
the
base
of
my
thumb
,
making
it
effortless
to
position
,
adjust
and
remove.the
capo
's
profile
is
comparable
in
size
to
the
keyser

without
the
keyser
's
protruding
high
angle
arm
neccessary

adequate
spring
tension

i
've

about

not

vary
the

the
case
with
some
other
brands
,

to
vary
the
pressure
exerted

the
amount
of
pressure
required
to
